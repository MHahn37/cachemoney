### Task 1
Task 1 is organized as a separate function for each layer of the OSI model. A user inputs a message and the program passes it to the top layer (Application Layer), which then passes it down layer by layer to the bottom layer (Physical Layer). Each function performs the layer's duties and prints the progress along the way. Some notable layers are the Transport and Network Layers, which add a port and IP to the message's headers, and the Data Link Layer, which utilizes a find and replace to implement Bit Stuffing and converts the message into bytes using ascii-to-bytes with padding to ensure there are always eight 1s or 0s per letter.
